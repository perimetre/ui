Valid layers are a base, components, and utilities.\nTailwind will automatically move any CSS within a @layer directive to the same place as the corresponding @tailwind rule, so you don't have to worry as much about authoring your CSS in a specific order to avoid specificity issues.\nWrapping any custom CSS in a @layer directive also tells Tailwind to consider those styles for purging when purging that layer.",
